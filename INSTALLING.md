To install KarrotObjectNotation in a compatible .NET project:
# Preferred Method(NuGet)
* Navigate to [the NuGet page](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KarrotObjectNotation/)
* Follow the page's instructions for installation

# Direct DLL Download
* Navigate to [the GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Mrcarrot1/KarrotObjectNotation/releases/latest)
* Download the appropriate DLL
* Add it as a dependency for your project(this can often be done through a menu in IDEs like Visual Studio but may require editing the CSPROJ file manually if you are not using an IDE).

# NuGet(through GitHub)
I also provide a NuGet package hosted on GitHub. It is not recommended to install this way, as it is significantly more complicated than the nuget.org method and may not be updated as often. If you wish to install this way, consult the GitHub help article [Working with the NuGet registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-nuget-registry).
